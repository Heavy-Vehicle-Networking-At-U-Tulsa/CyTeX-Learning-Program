## Read Live Engine RPM
Using a BeagleBone Black and a Truck Cape, connect to an engine contoller that is broadcasting non-zero engine RPM. Gather this data using candump. Interpret the raw CAN frames and extract information for Engine RPM, or J1939 SPN 190. Plot 20 seconds of changing RPM with matplotlib. Print the properly labeled plot to PDF and show it to your instructor.
