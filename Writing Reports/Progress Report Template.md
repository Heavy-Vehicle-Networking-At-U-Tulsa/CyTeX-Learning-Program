## Accomplishments
What was done? What was learned?

The information provided in this section allows the awarding agency to assess whether satisfactory progress has been made during this reporting period.

### What were the major goals and objectives of this project?
  * What was accomplished under these goals?
  * What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?
  * How were the results disseminated to communities of interest?
  * What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals and objectives?
State “Nothing to Report” if this is the final report.

### What were the major goals and objectives of this project?

List the major goals of the project as stated in the approved application or as approved by the agency, including the scientific or technological objectives of this effort. Describe the proposed technical approach to obtain those goals. If the application listed milestones/target dates for important activities or phases of the project, identify these dates and show actual completion dates or the percentage of completion.

Generally, the goals will not change from one reporting period to the next and are unlikely to change during the final reporting period. However, if the awarding agency approved changes to the goals during the reporting period, list the revised goals and objectives. Also explain any significant changes in approach or methods from the agency approved application or plan.

### What was accomplished under these goals?
For this reporting period describe: 
  1. major activities; 
  2. specific objectives; 
  3. significant results or key outcomes, including major findings, developments, or conclusions (both positive and negative); and/or 
  4. other achievements. 
Include a discussion of stated goals not met. As the project progresses to completion, the emphasis in reporting in this section should shift from reporting activities to reporting accomplishments.

### What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?

If the project was not intended to provide training and professional development opportunities or there is nothing significant to report during this reporting period, state “Nothing to to report.”

Describe opportunities provided for training and professional development to anyone who worked on the project or anyone who was involved in the activities supported by the project for this reporting period. "Training" activities are those in which individuals with advanced professional skills and experience assist others in attaining greater proficiency. Training activities may include, for example, courses or one-on-one work with a mentor. “Professional development” activities result in increased knowledge or skill in one’s area of expertise and may include workshops, conferences, seminars, study groups, and individual study. Include participation in conferences, workshops, and seminars not listed under major activities.

### How were the results disseminated to communities of interest?

If there is nothing significant to report during this reporting period, state “Nothing to Report.”

Describe how the results were disseminated to communities of interest for this reporting period. Include any outreach activities that were undertaken to reach members of communities who are not usually aware of these project activities, for the purpose of enhancing public understanding and increasing interest in learning and careers in science, technology, and the humanities.


### What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals and objectives?
If there are no changes to the agency-approved application or plan for this project or if this is the final report, state “Nothing to Report.”

Describe briefly what you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals and objectives.

IMPACT: What was the impact of the project? How has it contributed?
Over the years, the base of knowledge, techniques, people, and infrastructure created from research and research-related programs is drawn upon again and again for application to commercial technology and the economy, to health and safety, to cost-efficient environmental protection, to the solution of social problems, to numerous other aspects of the public welfare, and to other fields of endeavor.
The taxpaying public and its representatives deserve a periodic assessment to show them how the investments they make benefit the nation. Through this reporting format, and especially this section, recipients support that assessment.
Agencies use this information to assess how their research and research-related programs:
 increase the body of knowledge and techniques;
 enlarge the pool of people trained to develop knowledge and techniques or put it to use; and
 improve the physical, institutional, and information resources that enable those people to get their training and perform their functions.
INSTRUCTIONS - Impact
This component is used to describe ways in which the work, findings, and specific products of the project have had an impact during this reporting period. Describe distinctive contributions, major
accomplishments, innovations, successes, or any change in practice or behavior that has come about as a result of the project relative to:
 the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project;
 other disciplines;
 the development of human resources;
 teaching and educational experiences;
 physical, institutional, and information resources that form infrastructure;
 technology transfer (include transfer of results to entities in government or industry, adoption of new practices, or instances where research has led to the initiation of a start-up company)
 society beyond science and technology; or
 foreign countries.
